Intro
=================================================================
this was writen because I missed the feature and wanted it back.
now i have to admit that most of this code is copied from the
old mangos web v2 web site and modified to give it more features
and to simplify things for the end user.
=================================================================
Features:
=================================================================
 - view images that are on your server.
   (screenshots, wallpapers, other categories*, or all images.)
		*this module allowsyou to add your own category
		 if you want
 - allow users to upload images to any category.
 - allow site admin to add image categories to the list
		!!! do not remove the screenshots category as it is 
		    part of the main site not a module!!!

Features i want to add:
 - Allow users to edit comments on thier images and perhaps even
   remove them if they want
 - Give site admin a tool to remove/manage images on the site.
=================================================================
Instructions:
=================================================================
1: Install
	To install and start using this module, simply unpack 
	everything to a new folder in your modules folder and add a
	link to it on the front page.

2: Adding categories.
	a: open config.php, alllang files, and the cache folder

	   in config.php like so:

			'2' => 'walpaper'
		changes to
			'2' => 'walpaper',
			'3' => 'newcat'

		if you look at config.php, you will see this change 
		alreadymade and commented out for your referance ;)

	c: Add the title of your new category to your supported
	   languages in the lang_*.php files like so:

			'addyourown' => 'Add your Own'
